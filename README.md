This project is a Python simulation that explores the Dark Forest Hypothesis, a concept from astrophysics and the Fermi paradox. The Dark Forest Hypothesis suggests that advanced civilizations in the universe may choose to remain silent and hidden to avoid detection by other potentially hostile civilizations.
